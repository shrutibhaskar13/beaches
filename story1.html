    <p>Besant Nagar is an upscale, exclusive residential neighbourhood in South Chennai, India.[1] It is located along the coast of the Bay of Bengal.
     The neighbourhood is inhabited by highly affluent population and is dotted with many upmarket restaurants, cafes and boutiques. The main attraction is Elliot's Beach, named after Edward Elliot, the former Governor of Madras.[2] It forms the end-point of the Marina Beach shore. This has become an attractive spot for youngsters and elders alike with the pleasant sceneries and the ambiance it provides.
     Kalakshetra Academy, the dance school started in 1936 by Rukmini Devi Arundale and her husband George Arundale and their associates at the Theosophical Society is also present in this locality. Besant Nagar was developed by Tamil Nadu Housing Board (TNHB) in the early 1970s and up to the early 1980s. It was developed in an area of about 4 sq km encompassing the surroundings of Indra Nagar and Shastri Nagar.[3] TNHB developed residential plots, apartments, commercial complexes, wide roads, school zones, bus terminus and large parks. The Central Government Staff Quarters, popularly known as C.P.W.D. quarters, is located here and contributed to the development of the locality. Besant Nagar is also the residence of (former) World Chess Champion Viswanathan Anand.</p>
